# Birthday-problem

Birthday problem is well-known problem in probability theory. The objective is to find the probability that some people in a room will have the same birthday. 

The problem is only solvable by simplifying the assumption that each day is equally likely for a birthday. For this reason, 29 Feb is excluded and there are 365 possible birthdays in a year.

The codes provided are to calculate the probability of the birthday problem, given the number of people in the room.
